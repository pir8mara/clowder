# Decoder Strategy

Vendors sell decoder packs because raw CAN is not self-describing.

A raw frame might look like this:

```text
0x123  00 10 7F 00 AA 55 01 00
```

A DBC file tells software how to interpret it:

```text
message 0x123 = ExampleStatus
byte 2 bit 0..7 = temperature_raw
scale = 0.5
offset = -40
unit = C
```

## Strategy

1. Use public or authorized DBC files where available.
2. Treat paid decoders as convenience, not magic.
3. Assume OEM-proprietary signals will still need reverse engineering.
4. Keep every inferred signal labeled as inferred until validated.
5. Store your own DBC fragments as you confirm fields.

## Good signal evidence

A candidate signal becomes more credible when it changes only when the physical input changes, changes in the expected direction, repeats across captures, scales plausibly, and does not break when unrelated inputs change.

## Bad signal evidence

Weak evidence includes one capture only, many things changing at once, no experiment label, an LLM guess, or a value that merely matches wishful thinking. The CAN bus does not care about our feelings.
